testing J(w) with different d_e/d_h values

Form of J(w):
alpha_eid*pow(omega, 3.0)*(exp(-pow(omega/omega_c_eid, 2.0))+0.5*exp(-pow(omega/(k*omega_c_eid), 2.0))-exp(-pow(omega/(omega_c_eid),2.0)*(beta)))
==> trial with different cut off for electrons and holes, wc_h=k*wc_e,here k=1.3 and 1.121 is k*2**0.5/(k**2+1)**0.5=beta
==> trial with different cut off for electrons and holes, wc_h=k*wc_e,here k=2.5 and 1.313 is k*2**0.5/(k**2+1)**0.5=beta
